Analyze if the user seems confused, lost, or needs help based on their message and recent conversation context.

Types of confusion to detect:
- "what": User asking what something is or means
- "how": User asking how something works or how to do something  
- "help": User explicitly asking for help or assistance
- "unclear": User saying they don't understand or are confused
- "repeat": User asking to repeat or clarify something
- "none": User is not confused, just having normal conversation

IMPORTANT CONTEXT RULES:
- If the system recently asked for corrections (e.g., "provide valid future date", "past date", "invalid format"), and the user provides new information, this is a CORRECTION, not confusion.
- Date corrections after validation errors are normal flow continuations.
- Short contextual responses like "2", "Japan", "yes", or date ranges are normal continuations, not confusion.
- Only flag as confused if the user genuinely seems lost or explicitly asks for clarification.
- If user was asked to fix something and provides different information, treat as correction attempt, not confusion.
